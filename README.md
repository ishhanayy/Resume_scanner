# Resume Scanner Program
Build a simple Resume Scanner program using all the keywords on a resume to match the skills and qualifications needed for a particular job. I have used jupyter Notebook to create the document for resume scannner.
A resume scanner can be used to get the best candidates for the job posted in a matter of time.
